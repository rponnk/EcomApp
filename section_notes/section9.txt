path('<str:pk>/', views.getOrderById, name='user-order')

created the action and reducers

created order screen that will have the users order summary including if item is shipped or paid

created endpoint for updating if user paid

`/api/orders/${id}/pay/`, - the endpoint

paypal needs a seperate component/module to use their buttons
had to install react-paypal-button-v2

configured a sandbox paypal account,
once a user hits paypal button,
paypal accepts 2 conditions
-amount = tied to totalPrice
-success = on a success payment, paypal will run a successHandler that updates our backend

orders show in profile page based on who is logged in, regular vs staff
