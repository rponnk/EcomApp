created constants
created the reducers
-state will be empty for userlogin

registered userLoginReducer in store.js
created userActions file
    *created a const called login
        within this file config sets the headers to look for json
        make an api call with axios that makes a post request
        username to take email and password takes the password
        if successful, payload will carry the data, 
        stores information in localStorage and stringfies it
        otherwise it will fail and spit out error message

in store.js
after registering userLogin
created a userInfoFromStorage variable that grabs userInfo
if the data is blank it will return null otherwise will parse the data received in the payload

then added userLogin to initialState

issues -

frontend submit is making call not to the backend
having login button dissapear after user is logged in and making a drop down to logout or go to user profile
empty cart - cant remove item as this only removes the key, have to set localStorage instead
